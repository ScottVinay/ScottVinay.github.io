Hi! I'm Scott (on the far left in the purple T-shirt). I'm a machine learning researcher, physicist, tinkerer and maker of things.
In particular, I like to combine my passions for research, problem-solving, and technology to find ways to use machine learning and data to make a meaningful contribution to the world in the healthcare and social sectors. 

In my PhD on quantum communication protocols I developed novel methods for the analysis of statistical and security-related questions surrounding new quantum-based cryptography systems. This involved a new protocol for generating absolutely secure
keys (the most efficient practical proposal at time of publiucation) as well as optimising ways
of hacking a quantum system, and using thermal noise to defend against those same hackers (playing both sides). There was some cool stuff with complex analysis too so check out my thesis
if you're into that kind of thing.

I went to Australia for a while, where I worked building some of the groundwork for an NLP system to help
connect charities and NGOs with their goals. I'm now back in the UK and working on building machine learning
pipelines for the predictive analysis of electrocardiogram data. This identifies at-risk patients before they have a heart attack.

In my spare time I am a keen chess player, amateur magician, and dungeon master for my D&D group.

If you want to contact me for anything (including playing a game of online chess) feel free
