In this time of global health crisis, the importance of vaccines cannot be overstated. However, this is a message that reaches different sectors of society with varying degrees of success. The ability to predict who is most or least likely to get a vaccine is crucial in developing a suitable public health program and in deciding where to target public service announcements. Here I will look at a dataset made available by drivendata.org for a competition, in which the results of questionnaires which ask questions about the respondents' behaviours and attitudes towards the flu virus are compared with the information on whether the respondent did or did not receive the vaccine for the H1N1 bird flu, or for the seasonal flu.
